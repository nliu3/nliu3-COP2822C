            <h2>What is Cryptography?</h2>
            <p>
                <strong class="keyword">Cryptography</strong> is the science of secure communications, formed from the Greek words <em>krypt&#243;s</em> meaning "hidden" and <i>l&#243;gos</i>, meaning "word." The first recorded use of
                cryptography was by the Spartans who as early as 400 BC employed a cipher device called a <strong class="keyword">scytale</strong> to send secret communications between military commanders. The scytale consisted of a tapered baton around
                which was wrapped a piece of parchment inscribed with the message. Once unwrapped the parchment appeared to contain an incomprehensible set of letters; however when wrapped around another baton of identical size the original
                text appears.

                Cryptographers developed more and more ingenious systems, but it was in the 20 <sup>th</sup> Century that the science of cryptography took off. The first major achievement was the development of rotor cipher machines. An
                American, Edward Hebern recognized that by hardwiring alphabetic substitution in the connections from one side of an electrical rotor to those on the other side and cascading a collection of such rotors, alphabetic
                substitutions of almost any complexity could be produced. German engineers independently discovered the rotor concept and designed the precursors to the most famous cipher machine in history &ndash; the German
                <strong class="keyword">Enigma Machine</strong> which was used during World War II. The cracking of the Enigma ciphers by British and Polish cryptanalysts is one of the greatest triumphs in the history of cryptography and played an
                important role in the Allied victory.
